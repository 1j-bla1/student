# Issues and Kanbans
 
 
 
## How Issues and Kanbans are Used
 Issues and Kanbans are huge pieces in coding projects. When you have many different parts you must code it becomes hard to keep track of everything. Issues and Kanbans solve this problem by helping you and your group stay organized.
 
## How do Issues and Kanbans Work?
 
*Issues and Kanbans work by splitting your work you need to do into different parts. First what the Kanban does is split your work into a todo list, a in progress list, and a finished list. After you have a Kanban you add your Issues. When you make a issue you add them to them to the Kanban into the different lists. This helps you stay organized because you can see all the work you have to do and what work you need to complete.*  
 
## How to Create Kanbans and Issues
 
 
 
### Order to Make Issues and Kanbans
 
1. Create a Github Project
 
First you need to open github and create a project. To create a project you go to projects then click new project. Once you create your new project you need to select a template. Select the template "Team Planning" and then name your project. By doing this you get to the Kanban page.
 
2. Create Issues for your Kanban
 
After you have your Kanban created in your project you should see the sections todo, in progress, and Done. This is where you put your issues. To create a issue go to the bottom of the screen and select add item in any section you want. Once you do this you can create issues to show all the work you need to do. 
 
3. Add a Description to you Issue
 
Once you have created your issue you can make a description for it that will explain in more detail what you need to code. Once you add your description you can press create and you can see your issue in one of the columns. If you want your issue to change columns click the 3 dots next to it and select "Move to Column". This will move the issue to a different column
 
## Conclusion
 
In conclusion Kanbans and Issues are a great way to keep track of work for coding projects so you and your group can stay organized.
